# Fintech-Module-3-Challenge

# Bitcoin Arbitrage 

The third module challenge assignment is designed to help me understand how to find, clean, and compare data from two different csv files which represent the 'real world' data from two separate exchanges. In this example I was able to find, on a given day, if there is an arbitrage spread opportunity in the cost of Bitcoin between the two exchanges.
